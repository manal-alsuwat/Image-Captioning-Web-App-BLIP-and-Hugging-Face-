# 🖼️ Image Captioning Web App (BLIP + Hugging Face)

This project is a simple web application that generates captions for uploaded images using the **BLIP** (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining) model from **Hugging Face**.  
It demonstrates how computer vision and natural language processing can work together to describe images in human-like language.
